/**
 * Rotation quaternion, stored as the vector part followed by the scalar part.
 *
 * The class is not polymorphic and emits no RTTI descriptor, and no text dump writes component
 * labels for it. The component order is recovered rather than assumed, and three routines agree
 * on it. Set() from a matrix writes half the square root of one plus the matrix trace to the fourth
 * word and the three antisymmetric differences of the off-diagonal terms to the first three. Set()
 * from an axis and an angle writes the cosine of the half angle to the fourth word and the axis
 * scaled by the sine of the half angle to the first three. QuatMultiply() forms the Hamilton
 * product with the fourth word as the real part.
 *
 * The type is a full quadword of meaningful data rather than a padded triple. The four-term dot
 * product in QuatSlerp() proves that.
