/**
 * Emitter that spawns, integrates, and draws a population of particles.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef650`. It has three public non-virtual bases: `Rnd::Animatable`
 * at `+0x00`, `Rnd::Transformable` at `+0x20`, and `Rnd::Drawable` at `+0xd0`. All three derive
 * virtually from `Rnd::Object`. One shared Object subobject sits at `+0x200` and the factory
 * allocates 0x220 bytes.
 *
 * Four vtables belong to the class, each identified by its own GetTypeInfo slot addressing
 * `0x0052b2d8`. The Object subobject table at `0x00827b60` adjusts by `-0x200`, the Drawable table
 * at `0x00827af0` by `-0xd0`, the Transformable table at `0x00827b18` by `-0x20`, and the
 * Animatable table at `0x00827b38` by zero.
 *
 * The class overrides seven of the eight Object virtuals and two of the three Animatable ones. It
 * overrides nothing of Drawable or Transformable, so its Drawable table still addresses the base
 * DrawShowing() at `0x005066f0`, which draws nothing. Drawing belongs to Rnd::PsParticleSys.
 *
 * Particles live in two places at once. The pool is a vector of 0x80-byte records that the
 * constructor sizes to ten. The live set is a doubly linked list threaded through Particle::mNext
 * and Particle::mPrev from mLiveParticles, and the unused records of the pool form a free list
 * threaded through Particle::mNext from mFreeParticles of the owning system. AllocParticle() and
 * FreeParticle() move one record between the two lists, and each receives a system in $a0 and
 * reads mParticlesOwner, mLiveParticles, and the free list of the owner through it. Releasing a
 * particle that is already free reports "Tried to refree particle from ".
 *
 * Geometry is shared rather than copied, in the same arrangement Rnd::Mesh uses. A system whose
 * mParticlesOwner is another system draws that system's particles.
 *
 * The parameter block from `+0x108` to `+0x1f3` is named from the text dump at `0x00521f40`, which
 * reads each member under its label in the order "life:", " posLow:", " posHigh:", "speed:",
 * " pitch:", " yaw:", "emitRate:", " size:", the four colours, " collide:", " collidePlane:",
 * "force:", " mat:", " mode:", "numParticles:", " lineLength:", "bubblePeriod:", " bubbleSize:",
 * "bubble:", and " readZ:". The dump reads "numParticles:" from the size of the pool.
