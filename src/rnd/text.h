/**
 * Run of text drawn as a quad per glyph.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef4d0`. It has three public non-virtual bases whose offsets the
 * descriptor fixes: `Rnd::Drawable` at `+0x00`, `Rnd::Collideable` at `+0x14`, and
 * `Rnd::Transformable` at `+0x20`. All three derive virtually from `Rnd::Object`, so one shared
 * Object subobject sits at `+0x110`, which the constructor proves by writing that address into all
 * three virtual-base pointers.
 *
 * The class is 0x130 bytes, which the factory at `0x004cf800` pins by requesting exactly that
 * many. The last member ends at `0x12c`, and the quadword access to mColor gives the class 16-byte
 * alignment, which accounts for the remaining four bytes. The same alignment accounts for the
 * eight bytes between mZTest and the base subobject, since `0x108` is not a 16-byte boundary and
 * `0x110` is. Neither run is an unrecovered field.
 *
 * Four vtables belong to the class, laid out back to back and each terminated by an all-zero
 * entry. The three-entry table at `0x00822508` is addressed by the Rnd::Transformable vptr with a
 * `-0x20` adjustment, the three-entry table at `0x00822528` by the Rnd::Collideable vptr with a
 * `-0x14` adjustment, the eight-entry table at `0x00822548` by the Rnd::Drawable vptr with no
 * adjustment, and the eight-entry table at `0x00822590` by the Object subobject vptr with a
 * `-0x110` adjustment. Rnd::Drawable is the primary base, so the four virtuals this class declares
 * of its own occupy slots 4 through 7 of its table.
 *
 * The member titles come from the text DumpText() writes, "font:", " align:", "preWrapText:",
 * "color:", " word wrap:", " wrap width:", "text:", and "mesh:".
 *
 * Geometry is built rather than drawn directly. The object owns one Rnd::Mesh whose name is the
 * object's own inside `[` and `_mesh]`, has four vertices and two triangles per glyph, and takes
 * its material from the font. Every writer of a field that affects layout ends by rebuilding that
 * mesh, and a Text whose font is not a Material font builds nothing at all.
 *
 * Wrapping retains two strings. mPreWrapText is what a caller or a file supplied, and mText is the
 * same text with a newline inserted at every wrap point. mText is the string the mesh is built
 * from, and it is derived rather than stored, so only mPreWrapText is serialised.
