/**
 * Animation of the colours and the texture stages of one material.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef4b0`. It has `Rnd::Animatable` as its one public base at offset
 * 0. The constructor pins the Animatable subobject at 0x18 bytes from inside by storing the primary
 * vtable pointer at `+0x14` and the two Animatable lists at `+0x04` and `+0x08`. The members below
 * therefore start at `+0x18`, the MatAnim subobject is 0x40 bytes, and the shared Rnd::Object
 * subobject sits at `+0x40`. The creator at `0x004dcb00` allocates exactly 0x5c bytes, the 0x40
 * plus the 0x1c of the Object subobject with no surplus. The `-0x40` adjustment on every entry of
 * the Object subobject table confirms the offset from outside.
 *
 * Two vtables belong to the class, each with the type function at `0x004dbf10` in slot 0. The
 * Object subobject table at `0x00822d68` stores the destructor and the seven Object overrides, and
 * the primary table at `0x00822db0` stores FilteredFrameEnd() at slot 1 and SetFrameSelf(float) at
 * slot 3, followed by an all-zero terminator. Slot 2 still addresses the base
 * Rnd::Animatable::StartAnim() at `0x0049a3b8`, so restarting an animation does nothing of its own
 * here.
 *
 * Five channels animate the four material colours and the alpha, and the stage vector animates the
 * texture stages one for one against the material's own stages. Two independent readings agree on
 * which colour each channel drives. The text dump labels them " diffuseKeys:", "ambientKeys",
 * "emissiveKeys: ", "specularKeys:", and "alphaKeys:" in offset order. And SetFrameSelf() hands
 * each interpolated result to the material through vtable slot 10, slot 9, slot 11, slot 13, and
 * slot 12 respectively, which are Rnd::Mat::SetDiffuse(), SetAmbient(), SetEmissive(),
 * SetSpecular(), and SetAlpha() in the declaration order of src/rnd/mat.h.
 *
 * Keys are shared rather than copied, the same arrangement Rnd::MeshAnim uses with mKeysOwner.
 * FilteredFrameEnd() and SetFrameSelf() read the channels of mKeysOwner rather than their own.
