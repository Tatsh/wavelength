 * Mix-in for an object with a local and a world transform.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef770`. It has `Rnd::Object` as a public virtual base at offset
 * 0. The subobject is 0xac bytes: the virtual-base pointer at `+0x00`, mTransList at `+0x04`, two
 * unrecovered fields at `+0x08` and `+0x0c`, the two transforms, the origin, mDirty at `+0xa0`,
 * mBillboard at `+0xa4`, and the vptr at `+0xa8`. `Rnd::View` confirms the vptr offset by placing
 * its Transformable subobject at `+0x30` and writing that vptr to View + 0xd8.
 *
 * Each transform is four consecutive 16-byte rows of an x, a y, and a z float followed by
 * four bytes of padding, which is the layout the VU units read. The member titles come from the
 * text DumpText() writes, "localXfm:", "worldXfm:", "transList:", "billboard:", and " origin:".
 *
 * The class declares two virtuals of its own beyond the compiler-generated slot 0, SetBillboard
 * at slot 1 and UpdateWorldXfm at slot 2.
 *
 * `Rnd::Cam`, `Rnd::Mesh`, `Rnd::View`, and `Rnd::Arena` each place their next base immediately
 * after this subobject, at a distance of 0xb0 bytes from its start, which pins the size from
 * outside the class rather than from the highest store of a constructor. The 0xac the members
 * occupy rounds up to 0xb0 under the 16-byte alignment the transform rows impose.
