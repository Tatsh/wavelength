 */
typedef Object *(*ClassFactory)(const HxStr &name);

/**
 * Registry of every loaded renderer object, and of every class a `.rnd` file may instantiate.
 *
 * The class emits no RTTI descriptor, so it declares no virtual. Its title is settled all the same,
 * because the destructor at `0x00520348` passes the literal "Rnd::Manager" at `0x00826e98` to
 * OperatorDeleteOverride() as the tag for its own storage. Every other tag the renderer frees under
 * is a class name the RTTI also includes, "Rnd::Button", "Rnd::Font", "Rnd::Mat", "Rnd::Mesh",
 * "Rnd::Movie", and eleven more, so the vocabulary is the class-name vocabulary and this entry
 * belongs to it. No embedded `__FILE__` corroborates it, because the whole image holds exactly one
 * source path, `C:/FREQ/src/rndartt/abitmap.h`.
 *
 * The object is 0x20 bytes, four members of 0x0c, 0x04, 0x04, and 0x0c. The highest store the
 * constructor makes is the comparator byte of mClasses at `+0x1c`, and the four-member layout is
 * what fills the rest.
 *
 * The destructor destroys the members in reverse declaration order, mClasses, mMergeObjects,
 * mLoaded, and then mObjects, before the tagged free. That order is the evidence for the member
 * order declared below.
 *
 * `0x0051fe58` is library code rather than source. It is `mClasses.find()`, which Read() calls
 * twice and Create() calls once.
 *
 * Every Rnd::Object registers itself in mObjects on construction and erases that entry on
 * destruction, so Find() resolves any live object by name.
 *
 * These are the twenty-two classes Init() registers, with the factory for each. The first column
 * is the type name as it appears in a `.rnd` file.
 *
 * | Name              | Factory      | Name              | Factory      |
 * | ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
 * | `Arena`           | `0x005bba98` | `Mat`             | `0x004dbc80` |
 * | `Blur`            | `0x004c34e0` | `MatAnim`         | `0x004dcb00` |
 * | `Button`          | `0x00534678` | `Mesh`            | `0x00492f50` |
 * | `Cam`             | `0x004b23e0` | `MeshAnim`        | `0x00493a00` |
 * | `Environ`         | `0x00519278` | `Movie`           | `0x005d20b8` |
 * | `Font`            | `0x004cefe0` | `MultiMesh`       | `0x004ebb58` |
 * | `Generator`       | `0x0045e300` | `ParticleSys`     | `0x0052b6d8` |
 * | `Light`           | `0x00544828` | `ParticleSysAnim` | `0x0052c180` |
 * | `LightAnim`       | `0x005452d0` | `String`          | `0x004bf440` |
 * | `Text`            | `0x004cf770` | `Tex`             | `0x004e7770` |
 * | `TransAnim`       | `0x004fbf70` | `Tunnel`          | `0x00476468` |
 *
 * `Rnd::View` is absent from the table, and Read() is the reason. Read() resolves each file entry
 * by object name through mObjects before it consults the registry, and it compares the class name
 * of an object it already has against the literal "View" at `0x00827268`. A scene root is
 * therefore recognised rather than built by name, which is also why the factory at `0x004e2088`
 * has no reference anywhere in the image.
 *
 * The format version this build writes is 6, and Read() accepts 6 and below.
