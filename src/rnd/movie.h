/**
 * Animation that streams a compressed video file into a set of textures.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008efc90`. It has Rnd::Animatable as its only public non-virtual
 * base at offset 0. Rnd::Manager::RemapLegacyClassName() rewrites the earlier title `TexMovie` to
 * `Movie` for any file below format version 5. The rewrite identifies the class as the
 * texture-streaming one rather than a separate video surface.
 *
 * The object is 0x458 bytes, which the factory at `0x005d20b8` pins by requesting exactly that
 * many under the tag "Rnd::Movie" at `0x00835ba8`. Rnd::Animatable derives from Rnd::Object
 * virtually, so the Rnd::Object subobject is placed last, at `+0x43c`, which the `-0x43c`
 * adjustment on every entry of the Rnd::Object vtable below confirms. That subobject is 0x18
 * bytes, so four bytes of tail padding follow it.
 *
 * Two vtables belong to the class. The eight-entry table at `0x00835d60` is addressed by the
 * Rnd::Object subobject vptr and overrides seven of the eight Rnd::Object slots. The five-entry
 * table at `0x00835da8` is addressed by the Animatable vptr at `+0x14`; it inherits
 * FilteredFrameEnd() and StartAnim() from Rnd::Animatable, overrides SetFrameSelf(), and adds the
 * one virtual this class declares. Both tables end in an all-zero terminator entry rather than a
 * slot. Reading the second table's terminator as a slot would have run it into the literal pool
 * that follows it, where the bytes decode as further plausible-looking entries.
 *
 * A movie plays its file through one Rnd::AMovieSet, which it owns and deletes in
 * CloseMovieFile(). Each track of the file is attached to the texture mTrackTextures names for
 * it, and the stream passes that track's video chunks to OnChunk() as SetFrameSelf() advances it.
