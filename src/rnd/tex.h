/**
 * Texture, as a bitmap path plus the load state of its mip levels.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef140`. It has `Rnd::Object` as its one public non-virtual base
 * at offset 0. The class factory allocates 0x58 bytes. The texture's members therefore occupy
 * `+0x1c` through `+0x57`. The implementation file is `rndtex.cpp`, attested by its assert strings,
 * and the bitmap header it includes is `C:/FREQ/src/rndartt/abitmap.h`.
 *
 * A texture owns no pixels. The mip levels load asynchronously into the handle vector, and the
 * hardware residency belongs to the PlayStation 2 subclass Rnd::PsTex, whose GS slot state extends
 * the object past `+0x4a8`.
 *
 * The vtable has sixteen entries, so the class declares eight virtuals of its own beyond the six
 * of Rnd::Object. Slots 8 through 15 are ReloadBitmaps(), LockMipBitmap(), UnlockMipBitmap(),
 * SetPalette(), SetGsPageInUse(), FreeLoadedBitmaps(), RestoreSurfaces(), and OnMipLoaded().
 *
 * mFlags is the flag word DumpText() labels " flags:", and DumpText() lists its bits by name.
 *
 * mBitmapPath is a Rnd::FilePath, whose routines sit in this unit and take the path's address
 * rather than the texture's. SetBitmapConfig() installs the path through FilePath::Set() for a
 * verbatim path and through FilePath::SetFromRoot() to prefix FilePath::sRoot.
