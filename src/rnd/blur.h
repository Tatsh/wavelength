/**
 * Motion trail that redraws one drawable at the transforms it recently occupied.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef068`, its name string at `0x00821b28`, and its single base
 * entry at `0x00821b38` records `Rnd::Drawable` at offset 0, non-virtual and
 * public. The class is 0x4c bytes, which the factory at `0x004c3570` proves by allocating exactly
 * that much, and the `Rnd::Object` virtual base subobject sits at `0x30`, which the constructor
 * proves by writing that address into the virtual-base pointer at `+0x00`.
 *
 * Two vtables belong to the class. The four-entry table at `0x00821ae8` is addressed by the
 * `Rnd::Drawable` vptr at `+0x10` and overrides only DrawShowing(), and the eight-entry table at
 * `0x00821aa0` is addressed by the `Rnd::Object` subobject vptr with a `-0x30` adjustment on every
 * entry. Both tables end in an all-zero entry, which is the terminator rather than a null slot.
 *
 * The member titles come from the text DumpText() writes: "[Blur]", "mesh:", " length:",
 * " rate:", "falloff:", and " text:".
 *
 * The seventeen routines between `0x004b9a68` and `0x004bf858` belong to `Rnd::String`. Only the
 * routines listed below belong to this class.
