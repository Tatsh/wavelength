/**
 * Camera.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008eeeb8`. It has three public non-virtual bases: `Rnd::Drawable` at
 * offset 0, `Rnd::Transformable` at `0x20`, and `Rnd::Collideable` at `0xd0`. The class is 0x330
 * bytes. The factory at `0x004b2470` proves that size by allocating exactly that much under the tag
 * "Rnd::Cam". The virtual `Rnd::Object` subobject sits at `0x310`. The constructor proves the
 * offset by writing that address into all three virtual-base pointers.
 *
 * Each matrix and each frustum member is quadword aligned in the original. The four bytes between
 * the end of the `Rnd::Collideable` subobject at `0xdc` and the first matrix at `0xe0` are the
 * padding that alignment produces rather than a member.
 *
 * The member titles come from the text DumpText() writes: "nearPlane:", " farPlane:", " fov:",
 * "yRatio:", "screenRect:", "zRange:", " targetTex:", " localProject:", "worldProject:", and
 * "invWorldProject:". Both frustum member names come from the same dump. The names of the two
 * matrices the dump omits come from what builds them. That is, `0xe0` is the inverse of the world
 * transform and `0x160` is the inverse of the local projection.
 *
 * Four vtables belong to the class. The six-entry table at `0x00820958` is addressed by the
 * `Rnd::Drawable` vptr at `0x10` and stores the two virtuals declared here after the three
 * `Rnd::Drawable` ones. The three-entry table at `0x00820938` is addressed by the
 * `Rnd::Transformable` vptr at `0xc8`, the three-entry table at `0x00820918` by the
 * `Rnd::Collideable` vptr at `0xd8`, and the eight-entry table at `0x00820990` by the
 * `Rnd::Object` subobject vptr, each entry with the adjustment back to the Cam pointer.
 *
 * The routine at `0x004b1ff0` is an out-of-line copy of an inline accessor that returns
 * Cam::sCurrent. It has no caller, because every reader in the image loads the global
 * directly.
