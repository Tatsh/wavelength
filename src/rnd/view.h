/**
 * Root of a loadable scene.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef120`. The descriptor lists four public non-virtual bases and
 * fixes their subobject offsets, `Rnd::Animatable` at `+0x00`, `Rnd::Drawable` at `+0x18`,
 * `Rnd::Transformable` at `+0x30`, and `Rnd::Collideable` at `+0xe0`. The shared `Rnd::Object`
 * virtual base sits at `+0x100`, and the constructor writes that address into the virtual-base
 * pointer of all four subobjects. View's own four fields occupy `+0xf0` through `+0xff` and start
 * zeroed.
 *
 * Five vtables belong to the class, one per subobject plus the one the `Rnd::Object` subobject
 * vptr addresses. They are `0x00823628` (Animatable), `0x00823600` (Drawable), `0x008235e0`
 * (Transformable), `0x008235c0` (Collideable), and `0x00823650` (Object). Every entry of the last
 * four adjusts `this` back to the start of the View. The Drawable table repeats the base
 * implementations of SetShowing, SetHighlight, and DrawShowing, so View overrides none of the three
 * and draws nothing of its own.
 *
 * A `.rnd` file exposes its scene root under the name "view", which start-up resolves through
 * Rnd::Manager::Find().
 *
 * Five class keys resolve to this one class, which is what the four flags below record. Init()
 * registers "View" against a factory that sets no flag, and "Animatable", "Collideable",
 * "Drawable", and "Transformable" against four factories that each set one. A file naming a bare
 * mix-in therefore loads a View that remembers which mix-in was asked for.
 *
 * The destructor follows the engine pattern of dropping this object's own references and then
 * ReleaseAllRefs(). A view holds no reference of its own, so the first step is an empty body.
