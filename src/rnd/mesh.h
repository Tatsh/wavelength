/**
 * Indexed triangle mesh with one material.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008eed58`. It has three public non-virtual bases: `Rnd::Drawable` at
 * `+0x00`, `Rnd::Transformable` at `+0x20`, and `Rnd::Collideable` at `+0xd0`. All three derive
 * virtually from `Rnd::Object`. One shared Object subobject sits at `+0x150` and the whole object
 * is 0x16c bytes; the factory rounds the allocation to 0x170.
 *
 * Geometry is shared rather than copied. A mesh whose mVertsOwner is another mesh draws that
 * mesh's vertices, and its own vertex vector is released after a load or a copy. The same applies
 * to mFacesOwner for the face and edge vectors. A newly constructed mesh owns its own geometry,
 * because the constructor sets both owners to this.
 *
 * The drawing implementation belongs to the platform subclass. Rnd::PsMesh supplies DrawShowing()
 * and Sync(), and GfxDevice::Init() replaces the creator hook at `0x006eed60` with the PsMesh
 * factory, so every mesh a file loads on the PlayStation 2 is a PsMesh.
 *
 * The compiler-generated `GetTypeInfo()` is at `0x00492528`.
