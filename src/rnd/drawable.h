/**
 * Mix-in for an object that draws itself and then a list of other drawables.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef320`. It has `Rnd::Object` as a public virtual base at offset
 * 0. The subobject is 0x14 bytes. The compiler places the virtual-base pointer at `+0x00` and,
 * following the g++ 2.x layout for a class with no non-virtual base, the vptr at `+0x10`. The
 * declared members therefore occupy `+0x04` through `+0x0f`. For a standalone Drawable the
 * `Rnd::Object` subobject sits at `+0x14`.
 *
 * Two vtables belong to the class. The four-entry table at `0x00825498` is addressed by
 * the vptr at `+0x10` and stores the three virtuals declared here. The nine-entry table at
 * `0x008254c0` is addressed by the `Rnd::Object` subobject vptr and stores the overrides of the
 * `Rnd::Object` virtuals, each with a `-0x14` adjustment back to the Drawable subobject.
 *
 * Every entry of mDraws registers this object as a referrer through Rnd::Object::AddRef(), so a
 * drawable that goes away is removed from its parents' lists by Replace() rather than leaving a
 * stale pointer.
