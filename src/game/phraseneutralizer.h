/**
 * Neutraliser of the phrases a catching track has already captured.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ff3f0`. It is built over MsgSource at offset 0 and MsgSink at
 * offset 20. Its primary table is at `0x007e2e88` with four entries. Its MsgSink subobject table at
 * `0x007e2e60` adjusts `this` by `-20` and fills slot 3 with DispatchPriv(). MsgSource coming
 * first is why CatchingSTG's wiring adjusts by `+0x14` when it registers this object as a sink and
 * guards the adjustment against a null pointer. CatchingSTG's tagged allocation measures the object
 * at 0x3c bytes.
 *
 * The destructor at `0x001c1478` is implicitly declared. It restores the base tables, frees
 * MsgSource's vector, and releases the object under MsgSink's tag.
