 * Filter that stops a track's notes while it is disabled and passes everything else.

 * It has MsgSource at offset 0 and MsgSink at `+0x14`. Its tables are at `0x007df530` and
 * `0x007df508`, the second adjusting `this` by `-20`. The unit spans `0x001a6a58` through
 * `0x001a6fb8`. BGTrackGraph's constructor creates the one instance each background track has, with
 * the constructor expanded inline.
 *
 * While mEnabled is clear, DispatchPriv() drops every NoteMsg and every StdMidiMsg whose status
 * is a note-off or a note-on, and forwards the rest.
 *
 * The unreferenced forwarder at `0x001a6ed8` in this unit, byte-identical to
 * MsgJoiner::DispatchPriv() at `0x00195b70`, has its unwind record at `0x006852d8` as its only
 * reference and is recorded here rather than declared.
