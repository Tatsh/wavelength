/**
 * Translator of analogue stick movement into track control.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x00901ba0`. It is built over MsgSink at offset 0 and MsgSource at
 * offset 4. Its primary table is at `0x007de2b8` with four entries and its MsgSource subobject
 * table at `0x007de290` with four. The object is 0x38 bytes, which AxingSTG's tagged allocation
 * measures.
 *
 * Slot 0 of the table at `0x007de2b8` addresses the accessor at `0x0019f868`. The accessor guards
 * on the descriptor at `0x00901ba0`, and the descriptor settles the class name.
 *
 * The stick's position reaches the class as an AxisRegisterMsg. The coarse position becomes a
 * NowBarMsg lane for the display, and a note played on a sustained tick bends the pitch with the
 * stick until the next note or an AllNotesOffMsg.
 *
 * The destructor at `0x0019f6a8` is implicitly declared.
