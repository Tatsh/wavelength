 * Producer of the gems a guitar or vocal track presents, in its later form.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008efc20`. It is built over MsgSink at offset 0 and MsgSource at
 * offset 4. Its primary table is at `0x007dee40` with four entries and its MsgSource subobject
 * table at `0x007dee18` with four. The object is 0x2c bytes, which the tagged allocations in
 * AxingSTG and VoxingSTG both measure.
 *
 * The maker turns the live MIDI of mPlayer into gems as it arrives. A note-on becomes a DurGemMsg
 * 80 ticks long, and the sustain pedal on controller 46 opens and closes a SusGemMsg strip.
 *
 * The destructor at `0x001a2e48` is implicitly declared. It destroys MsgSource's vector and
 * releases the object under MsgSink's tag.
