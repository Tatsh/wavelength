/**
 * Player of the phrases one track is divided into.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008eff30`. It is built over MsgSource at offset 0 and MsgSink at
 * offset 20. The primary table is at `0x007e3120` with four entries and the MsgSink subobject table
 * at `0x007e30f8`. MsgSource coming first is why every upcast to MsgSink in the stage classes
 * adjusts by `+0x14` and guards the adjustment against a null pointer. The object is 0x30 bytes,
 * which ScoreTrackGraph's constructor measures at `0x001cef40`.
 *
 * Each bar sends the bar's phrase to the sinks as one MultiMuseMsg. How the sequence is built
 * depends on the track mode: an axe or vocal track sends the phrase's own sequence, a riff or
 * scratch track the riff of every phrase gem, and a catch track the riff of every gem of the bar.
 *
 * The destructor at `0x001c2658` is implicitly declared. It restores the base tables, frees
 * MsgSource's vector, and releases the object under MsgSink's tag.
