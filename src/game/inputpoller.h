/**
 * Reader of the physical controllers.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x0086f6d8`. It has no base. The vptr lands after the data at
 * `+0x58`, and the class is 0x5c bytes. Its vtable at `0x007e69b8` has two entries and a zero
 * terminator at index 2, the type function and the destructor at `0x001df080`. The destructor is
 * the only virtual the class declares. The size comes from the allocation in the GameManagerImpl
 * constructor.
 *
 * The translation unit is `InputPollerPS2.cpp`, which the anonymous-namespace marker
 * `Q235_GLOBAL_$N$InputPollerPS2.cppXFKhgb24FindJoypadConnectionsCmd` at `0x007e6ae8` records. That
 * same marker names one file-private class, FindJoypadConnectionsCmd. The file is therefore the
 * PlayStation 2 implementation, and a reconstructed implementation belongs at that basename rather
 * than at a portable one. The string pool of the unit also holds the InputCheatDetector family and
 * the cheat phrases, so the cheat decoder shares the file.
 *
 * The member map comes from the constructor at `0x001ded98`, the destructor, and the setup routine
 * at `0x001df248` together, and it accounts for every byte up to the vptr. The purpose of each
 * member is mostly unrecovered, so those members are private.
 *
 * The constructor finishes in Init(), and the destructor begins with Shutdown().
