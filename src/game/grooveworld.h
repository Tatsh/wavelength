/**
 * Owner of the world a game session runs in.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008eff70`. It has MsgSink as a public base at offset 0 and
 * RawController as a public base at `+0x04`. The allocation in GameManagerImpl::CreateWorld() fixes
 * the object at 0xbc bytes. The tagged release at `0x00194d5c` records the translation unit as
 * `GrooveWorld.cpp` with line 302. ControllerCmd and the file-local FuncCmd and ExitCmd share the
 * unit.
 *
 * Two vtables belong to the class, and the secondary one precedes the primary one in memory. The
 * RawController subobject addresses `0x007dc628`, whose three entries each adjust `this` by `-4`,
 * and the MsgSink subobject addresses `0x007dc648` with no adjustment. The primary table has four
 * entries and a zero terminator at index 4, the type function at `0x001936f8`, the destructor at
 * `0x0018c368`, the inherited MsgSink::Dispatch() at `0x00105158`, and the DispatchPriv() override
 * below. The secondary table has three entries and a zero terminator at index 3, the same type
 * function and destructor followed by the RawController override below.
 *
 * The member map comes from the constructor, the destructor, and BuildGraphs(). BuildGraphs()
 * creates the input map, the track selector, the message joiner, the delayer, the gamer, the
 * synthesiser, and the score track graphs, and each type is resolved through the table its
 * constructor installs. mState steps through 1 while the level file loads, 2 once it is
 * converted, 4 while the world accepts controller readings, and 6 on one shutdown path.
 *
 * GameManagerImpl reads mInputMap from three of its handlers, writes mIsPlayback from its load path
 * and its begin-game handler, and reads mIsTutorial from its unpause handler. `0x0018dc88` and
 * `0x0018de38` both run once the world is ready.
