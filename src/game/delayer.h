class Message;

/**
 * Sink that forwards the messages it receives to its own sinks.
 *
 * It has MsgSink at offset 0 and MsgSource at `+0x04`. Its primary table at `0x00817720` runs four
 * entries: the type function, the destructor at `0x0040cee8`, the inherited MsgSink::Dispatch(),
 * and the DispatchPriv() override below. The MsgSource table at `0x008176f8` adjusts `this` by `-4`
 * for the first two entries and retains MsgSource::AddSink() and MsgSource::RemoveSink().
 * GrooveWorld's setup routine at `0x0018cce8` creates the one instance with a 0x18-byte allocation.
 * The allocation has no room for a member beyond the two bases.
 *
 * The class is declared for GrooveWorld, which hands it every CripplePacket. The default
 * constructor at `0x0040d060` is the implicit one and is not written. It stores the MsgSink
 * table, runs the MsgSource default constructor at `0x00115cc0`, and then installs the two tables
 * above.
 *
 * The unreferenced forwarder at `0x0040d0d0` in this unit, byte-identical to
 * MsgSplitter::DispatchPriv() at `0x001ab4a8`, has its unwind record at `0x006de75c` as its only
 * reference and is recorded here rather than declared.
