/**
 * Producer of the gems a guitar or vocal track presents, in its earlier form.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef220`. It is built over MsgSink at offset 0 and MsgSource at
 * offset 4. Its primary table is at `0x007dedf0` with four entries and its MsgSource subobject
 * table at `0x007dedc8` with four. The object is 0x28 bytes, which the tagged allocations in
 * AxingSTG and VoxingSTG both measure.
 *
 * Both classes build one of these and one AxeNewGemMaker, and the pair coexists rather than one
 * replacing the other. Which of the two a given track reaches is not recovered.
 *
 * The maker replays a PhraseMsg's sequence through its own DispatchPriv(), advancing mPosition to
 * each entry. Every NoteMsg becomes a DurGemMsg from mPosition, and a sustain-pedal release and
 * press on controller 46 bound a DurGemMsg of their own.
 *
 * The destructor at `0x001a3f90` is implicitly declared. It destroys MsgSource's vector and
 * releases the object under MsgSink's tag.
