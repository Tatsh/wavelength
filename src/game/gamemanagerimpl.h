 *
 * The split between GameManager and GameManagerImpl cannot be recovered. No vtable in the image
 * addresses a GameManager subobject, the accessor at `0x0010b7c8` builds both descriptors and
 * returns the derived one, and nothing outside the accessor references `0x008ef6b0`. Every slot is
 * therefore declared here, on the derived class the vtable belongs to, and the base is declared
 * only so that the descriptor chain reads correctly.
 *
 * Every entry of the 39-entry table. Slot 0 is the compiler-generated type function at `0x0010b7c8`
 * and is not source. Slot 2 is MsgSink::Dispatch() at `0x00105158`, inherited unchanged.

 * The five handler slots are each pinned by DispatchPriv(), which compares the reported message
 * type against five globals and dispatches one slot for each. `0x006d03a4` belongs to
 * BeginGameLocalMsg, `0x006d03ac` to EndGameMsg, `0x006d03b4` to PauseGameSystemMsg, `0x006d03bc`
 * to UnpauseGameSystemMsg, and `0x006d03c4` to GameManagerDoPlaybackMsg. Each of the five globals
 * has exactly two readers, this dispatcher and the message class's own type reporter, which is what
 * makes the pairing certain. A type that matches none of the five trips
 * `FatalError("DISPATCH_CHECK: Unhandled Message: %s", pMsg->Name())`.
 *
 * StartRecording() installs a GameRecorder and Recreate() a GamePlaybacker.
 *
 * Four slots read or write the embedded settings rather than a member of this class. The offsets
 * `+0x84`, `+0x88`, and `+0x90` all fall inside the 0x38-byte GameParams subobject at `+0x68`, so
 * SetPlayMode() and GetPlayMode() drive `GameParams::mPlayMode`, SetDifficulty() and
 * GetDifficulty() drive `GameParams::mDifficulty`, and SetGameMode() writes
 * `GameParams::mNetGame`. Those three settings members are public for that reason, and a friend
 * declaration on GameParams would fit the image equally well.
 *
 * Every member of this class is private. Nothing outside the class touches one directly, and each
 * of the members a caller needs has a virtual accessor among slots 9 to 31.
