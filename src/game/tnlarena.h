/**
 * Game-side controller of the arena screens around the tunnel.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef930`. It has MsgSink as its one public base at offset 0. Its
 * type function is at `0x0040c138`. It is a game-side tunnel class rather than a Rnd one.
 *
 * The table at `0x00817390` has four entries, the same length as MsgSink's table at `0x007ccc40`,
 * and the class therefore introduces no virtual. It overrides the destructor at slot 1 and
 * DispatchPriv() at slot 3, and inherits MsgSink::Dispatch() at slot 2.
 *
 * The object is 0x2c bytes, the size Renderer's constructor requests under the MsgSink tag at
 * `0x0042c8fc`. The constructor records the object in g_pTnlArena and the destructor clears it.
 *
 * The arena shows the game on four screens, whose materials are `screen01.mat` to `screen04.mat`.
 * The constructor finds every Rnd::Mesh that uses each of the four and records the mesh with its
 * material in mScreenMeshes. It then builds one PlayerMaterial per world player, and one of three
 * ScreenAnim classes by mode. Configuration code 0x3a1 selects the plain ScreenAnim, game mode 1
 * selects SoloScreenAnim, and every other mode selects MultiScreenAnim.
