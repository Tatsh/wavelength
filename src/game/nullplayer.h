/**
 * Stand-in for an absent player.
 *
 * `NullPlayer` in the RTTI descriptor at `0x008ef210`, with `Player` as its only base. Its three
 * vtables are at `0x007d24e0`, `0x007d24b8`, and `0x007d2490`, each walked to its terminator.
 *
 * The primary table has 21 entries, the same as the base, so this class adds no virtual. It
 * replaces one primary slot, IsNull at index 3, and `DispatchPriv` in its `MsgSink` table, which
 * it empties so that the stand-in ignores every message. It inherits
 * everything else. Two members against the base's nineteen is what makes this the null-object
 * member of the family, and the base being an interface with inert defaults is what lets it be
 * that small.
 *
 * No destructor is declared here. The routine at `0x001324e8` occupies slot 1 of all three of this
 * class's tables, so it is this class's destructor rather than a stray copy, and it is
 * byte-identical to the base destructor because a trivial derived destructor stores its own table
 * pointer, the inlined base destructor overwrites it, and the dead first store is dropped. The
 * compiler therefore generates it from an implicit declaration and the source owes no definition.
 *
 * The two routines at `0x00133528` and `0x00133530` sit at the same index, 3, in two different
 * tables, the `MsgSink` one and the primary one.
