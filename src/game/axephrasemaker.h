/**
 * Phrase maker for a guitar track.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008f2a50`. It has PhraseMaker as its only base at offset 0. Its
 * primary table is at `0x007ddc50` with six entries and its MsgSource subobject table at
 * `0x007ddc28` with four. The class introduces two virtuals. The object is 0x50 bytes, measured by
 * AxingSTG's tagged allocation.
 *
 * Slot 0 of the table at `0x007ddc50` addresses the accessor at `0x0019d390`. The accessor guards
 * on the descriptor at `0x008f2a50`, and the descriptor settles the class name.
 *
 * The maker records what the player plays over a bar into a fresh Phrase and installs it in the
 * phrase manager when the bar ends. A note-on is held until its note-off (or the end of the bar)
 * gives it a length, and every recorded message also records the current axis value.
 *
 * The destructor at `0x0019b7f0` is implicitly declared. It destroys mHeldNotes and MsgSource's
 * vector and releases the object under MsgSink's tag.
