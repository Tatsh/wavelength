/**
 * Player driven by a remote machine.

 * `NetPlayer` in the RTTI descriptor at `0x008eef18`, with `Player` as its only base. Its three
 * vtables are at `0x007d0ab0`, `0x007d0a88`, and `0x007d0a60`, each walked to its terminator.
 *
 * The primary table has 21 entries, the same as the base, so this class adds no virtual and only
 * replaces. It replaces exactly two of the base's slots, 4 and 5, where the base returns -1 and 0,
 * and it replaces `DispatchPriv` in its `MsgSink` table. It inherits both `MsgSource` virtuals
 * and every other primary slot, which makes it a thin specialisation rather than a parallel
 * implementation.
 *
 * Two members are recovered, the track and place slots 4 and 5 return, where the base returns -1
 * and 0 instead. The bytes from `+0x2c` to `+0x47` are unrecovered. Its destructor restores the
 * base tables and releases the pointer the base declares at `+0x28`. That work is the inlined base
 * destructor, and the destructor body is empty.
