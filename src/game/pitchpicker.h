/**
 * Chooser of which pitch a guitar track's input resolves to.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008eef88`. It is built over MsgSink at offset 0 and MsgSource at
 * offset 4. Its primary table is at `0x007e3418` with four entries and its MsgSource subobject
 * table at `0x007e33f0` with four, which adjusts `this` by `-4`. The object is 0x50 bytes, which
 * AxingSTG's tagged allocation measures.
 *
 * A note-on picks a pitch from the harmony in force, offset by the axis position across the range
 * of the current riff, and records the pairing so the matching note-off releases the same pitch.
 * Notes at the tick of the last SustainNoteMsg reuse the pitch a sustained note already received.
 *
 * The destructor at `0x001c3e10` is implicitly declared. It restores the base tables, destroys the
 * two note vectors and MsgSource's vector, and releases the object under MsgSink's tag.
