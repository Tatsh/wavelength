/**
 * Dispatcher of one range of timed messages against a clock.
 *
 * The one instantiation in the image is `Sequencer<TickObj<MuseMsg *> const *>`, whose descriptor
 * is at `0x008eec48` with GenericSequencer as its one base at offset 0 and whose table is at
 * `0x007cc7e8`. MultiMusePlayer::Start() and BarSequencer::Tick() construct it, each taking 0x2c
 * bytes under the tag `Sequencer`.
 *
 * Post() records the clock and the sink and sends the range in order, each message at its own
 * position relative to the clock's position at the post. A message due at once is sent
 * immediately, and a later one waits for SequencerCmd. The bodies are template code, and the one
 * instantiation's out-of-line copies sit in the Sequencer unit with further per-unit copies
 * elsewhere.
