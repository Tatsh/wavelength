/**
 * Base of every event the game passes between a MsgSource and a MsgSink.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x0086f638`. It has no base and no data members. The
 * compiler-generated vptr lands at offset 0 and every derived message adds its payload after it.
 * The RTTI lists 124 derived classes, among them ScriptMsg, GemMsg, LeaveGameMsg, and Packet.
 *
 * Every vtable in the family is eight entries, and the declaration order below reproduces the
 * order after the compiler-generated slot 0. Each one was read off the concrete implementations
 * rather than off the declaration: a scan of the derived tables found 80 classes that implement
 * Clone(), Type(), and GetName(), while Packet and eight others inherit all three as pure and are
 * therefore abstract themselves.
 *
 * This class's own table is at `0x007ccbf8`, which its destructor stores at offset 0. It has eight
 * entries and a zero terminator at index 8, with slots 2, 3, and 4 addressing the pure-virtual
 * stub. MsgSink's table follows it immediately at `0x007ccc40`.
 *
 * Slots 5, 6, and 7 all address a two-instruction `jr ra` stub in this class, at `0x001051f0`,
 * `0x001051f8`, and `0x00105200`. Every translation unit that destroys a message emits its own
 * copy of all three stubs after its copy of the destructor, which is a second measurement of the
 * count.
 *
 * The three pure virtuals follow one pattern per class. LeaveGameMsg at `0x00812078` and GemMsg at
 * `0x00812588` are the two worked examples cited below.
 *
 * A concrete message also supplies a static New() that returns a default-constructed instance on
 * the heap, and the translation unit at `0x003d9818` registers 92 of them against the identity
 * Type() reports. Each registration constructs one file-scope object of a 4-byte class with the
 * identity word immediately below it, passing the identity and the factory to the MessageFactory
 * constructor, which inserts the pair into a sorted vector and stores nothing in the object.
