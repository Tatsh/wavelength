/**
 * Event the game passes between a MsgSource and a MsgSink.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008efd40`. It has Message as its one base. The object is 0xc bytes
 * and its vtable is at `0x00811e80`. The whole payload is the single HxStr at `+0x04`. Clone()
 * copies it inline through HxStr::HxStr(const HxStr &) rather than delegating, and the cleanup
 * block that follows is the compiler unwinding the copy if it throws.
 *
 * Unlike its two siblings, PrintExtra() writes nothing, although the class has the same string.
 *
 * The destructor at `0x003e1b18` is compiler-generated and has no declaration here. So is the
 * string copy at `0x003e1d68`, the same shape as GameConnectFailureMsg's at `0x003e1868`.
