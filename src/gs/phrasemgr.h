/**
 * Owner of the gem phrases on one track, and the seam between the network and the gems.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x00901fd0`. It has MsgSink at offset 0 and MsgSource at offset 4, and
 * it is named after `GsPhraseMgr.cpp`, the translation unit its two file-local classes record.
 * Those two are `Cmd` at `0x008f0960` and `ExportCmd` at `0x009021f0`, both deriving from
 * Sch::Command. Its primary table is at `0x007e28d0` and its MsgSource table at `0x007e28a8`, and
 * each runs four entries. ScoreTrackGraph's tagged allocation measures the object at 0x60 bytes.
 * The signature of `Catcher::Catcher()` also records the class name, and every stage passes the
 * manager it retains to the catcher it builds.
 *
 * Every member below posts one message through its own MsgSource half, which is what the titles
 * describe. PostPhraseMsg() looks the phrase up through PhraseDatabase::GetPhraseAt() on
 * mDatabase, and when that lookup reports a phrase it builds a PhraseMsg with the argument at
 * `+0x04`, mTrack at `+0x08`, and the phrase at `+0x0c`, and delivers it through
 * MsgSource::Send().
 *
 * DispatchPriv() dispatches six identities, three of them packets rather than messages. A
 * PhrasePacket, a CaughtPhrasePacket, and a GemPacket arrive from the network, and an
 * InvalidateTrackMsg, a RefreshNetMsg, and a GameBeginMsg arrive locally. The PhrasePacket and the
 * InvalidateTrackMsg paths both loop, clearing and posting bars through RefreshBar(), and the
 * PhrasePacket path is guarded on the packet's `+0x14` matching mTrack.
 *
 * The constructor fixes the member map from `+0x18` to the end. The MsgSource subobject occupies
 * `+0x04` through `+0x17`, so the region at `+0x10` the destructor tears down is that subobject's
 * vector rather than a member of this class. The destructor deletes mDatabase and mPowerbarMgr
 * through slot 1 of each table, which is the destructor slot.
