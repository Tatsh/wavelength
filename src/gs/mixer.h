/**
 * Per-track MIDI mixer that sits between a track graph and the synthesiser.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008f0770`. It has MsgSink as its one base, and the inherited vptr
 * sits at offset 0. The allocations in BGTrackGraph::CreateMixer() and ScoreTrackGraph's
 * constructor both measure the object at 0x58 bytes. Its vtable is at `0x007df900` and runs four
 * entries.
 *
 * It is a MIDI filter on one channel. Every message it emits is a StdMidiMsg built on the stack
 * and handed to mOutput, with the channel taken from mChannel. A StdMidiMsg arriving with a
 * control-change status goes through ApplyControlChange().
 *
 * SetGainFactor() is what fixes the four factors. It multiplies all four together and divides by
 * 127 cubed, which normalises a product of four 7-bit values back into a 7-bit value, and sends
 * that as controller 11. Four independent gains therefore scale one channel's expression.
 *
 * The name comes from the RTTI descriptor.
