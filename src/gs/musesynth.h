/**
 * Owner of the players that are sounding, and the sink that starts them.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x00902290`. It has MsgSink at offset 0 and MuseParent at offset 4.
 * MultiMusePlayer's MusePlayer base at offset 48 confirms the object size of 0x30 bytes. Its
 * primary table is at `0x007e0008` and its MuseParent table at `0x007dffe8`.
 *
 * It is a MsgSink that creates a player per message. A NoteMsg creates a 0x20-byte NotePlayer
 * through the constructor at `0x001b4328`, a MultiMuseMsg creates a MultiMusePlayer, and an
 * AllNotesOffMsg releases every player. A StdMidiMsg or a SustainNoteMsg is instead forwarded
 * straight to mOutput, so a message that needs no scheduling bypasses the player list. Every other
 * message is discarded.
 *
 * Every player it creates is started against mOutput, which addresses its own embedded
 * MsgSplitter, or the sustainer CreateSustainer() places in front of it. AddSink() registers a
 * sink with that splitter, so a caller that wants the sound registers once here rather than with
 * each player.
 *
 * The name comes from the RTTI descriptor.
