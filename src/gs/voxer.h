/**
 * Pitcher that drives the vocal track.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008f0830`. It has Pitcher as its one base. Its three tables are at
 * `0x007e61a8`, `0x007e6180`, and `0x007e6150`, and it overrides exactly the two slots Pitcher
 * declares pure: DispatchPriv() in the primary table and Tick() in the TickTask table. VoxingSTG's
 * tagged allocation measures the object at 0x70 bytes, and VoxingSTG builds exactly one of these
 * without branching.
 *
 * The constructor takes four arguments, the fourth in `t0`, and fixes the layout of the derived
 * part. It constructs the TickTask base with a period of 1920 ticks, which is one measure at 480
 * ticks per quarter note. VoxingSTG's call at `0x001da0b0` passes its phrase manager, its
 * quantiser, the song clock, and its track description, which types all four.
 *
 * The Voxer records what the singer holds into a Phrase per bar, as AxePhraseMaker does for a
 * guitar. Holding any PitchRiffMsg level presses the sustain controller (46) and releasing the
 * last one lets it go.
