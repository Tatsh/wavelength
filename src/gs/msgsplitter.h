/**
 * Sink that delivers everything it receives to every registered sink.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008f0800`. It has MsgSink at offset 0 and MsgSource at offset 4. The
 * object is 0x18 bytes: the MsgSink vptr at `+0x00`, the MsgSource subobject over `+0x04` through
 * `+0x17`, and the MsgSource vptr inside that at `+0x14`. The class declares no data member.
 *
 * Its primary table is at `0x007e0128` and its MsgSource table at `0x007e0100`. MuseSynth embeds
 * one at `+0x0c` and exposes it as the sink every player it creates sends to.
 *
 * The three bodies sit inside MuseSynth's run of code, so they are written in that translation
 * unit. The name comes from the RTTI descriptor.
