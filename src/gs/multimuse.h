/**
 * Sequence of messages, each at a song position.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008ef088`. Amplitude's RTTI records Muse as the base. The allocation
 * in MultiMuseMsg::restoreGuts() measures the object at 0x14 bytes. Its layout is the reference
 * count at `+0x00`, the vptr at `+0x04`, and the vector over `+0x08` through `+0x13`. Its vtable is
 * at `0x007dfb78` and runs four entries, slot 2 retaining Attachment::Destroy().
 *
 * The element type is attested. The one Sequencer instantiation in the image is
 * `Sequencer<TickObj<MuseMsg *> const *>` at `0x008eec48`, and MultiMusePlayer::Start() posts one
 * of those over this vector's start and finish. SaveFields() agrees with that shape independently:
 * it advances eight bytes per element and writes the first word through Sch::Tick::saveGuts() and
 * the second through `operator<<(OBStream &, Message *)`.
 *
 * MultiMuseMsg carries one of these and is how a sequence moves between a MsgSource and a
 * MsgSink, and MultiMusePlayer is what turns one into messages over time.
