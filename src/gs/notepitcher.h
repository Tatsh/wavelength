/**
 * Pitcher that drives a note track.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008eef68`. It has Pitcher as its one base. Its three tables are at
 * `0x007e14a0`, `0x007e1478`, and `0x007e1448`, and it overrides exactly the two slots Pitcher
 * declares pure. PitchingSTG's tagged allocation measures the object at 0x70 bytes, and PitchingSTG
 * builds one of these when the track's kind word is 2 and a Scratcher when it is 3.
 *
 * It ignores an EraseOffMsg rather than forwarding it, which is the one message the three Pitcher
 * subclasses treat differently from each other.
 *
 * The names of the routines DispatchPriv() and Tick() dispatch to come from the message each
 * routine posts rather than from the message it receives.
