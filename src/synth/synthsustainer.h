/**
 * Message filter that suppresses note-offs for the notes a sustain request covers.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008f2a70`. It derives from MsgSink at offset 0. The base vptr lands
 * at `+0x00` and the class is 0x20 bytes. Its vtable is at `0x007e5b00` and runs the type
 * function, the destructor, the inherited MsgSink::Dispatch(), and DispatchPriv().
 *
 * Two sets of note numbers drive the filter. The sounding set records every note a note-on has let
 * through, and the sustained set records every note a SustainNoteMsg has requested the filter
 * sustain. A note-off for a sustained note is discarded, a note-on for a sustained note drops it
 * from the sustained set instead of going downstream, and every other MIDI message goes
 * downstream unchanged.
 *
 * The descriptor at `0x008f2a70` is what settles the name.
