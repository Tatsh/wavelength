/**
 * Front-end renderer that draws nothing, chosen in place of MetRenderer by a configuration option.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008eff00`. It has RendererBase as its one public base at offset 0.
 * MetaGameWorld::CreateRenderer() allocates it at 0x88 bytes under the `MsgSink` tag when
 * PythonEvt::QueryOption() reports option 0xcb set. Its vtable at `0x00801d58` has eleven entries,
 * the same length as RendererBase's. Against that table it overrides the destructor and slots 3, 7,
 * and 8, the three slots RendererBase declares pure. Slots 4 and 5 have two-instruction empty
 * bodies at `0x00311a10` and `0x00311a18`, the base's empty bodies re-emitted rather than
 * overrides, and are not declared.
 *
 * In place of the front-end screens, the X button evaluates a ruleset script template and loads
 * the level it describes, and slot 8 starts a local game once the load finishes.
