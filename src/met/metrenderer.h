/**
 * Front-end renderer that owns the screen stack and drives every MetScreen.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008eef98`. It has three public non-virtual bases at fixed offsets,
 * MsgSource at `+0x00`, RendererBase at `+0x14`, and FadeUser at `+0x5c`. Its GetTypeInfo is at
 * `0x00370f98`.
 *
 * MetScreen stores its renderer at `+0x10` and registers itself on it as a message sink through
 * MsgSource::AddSink() during construction, which is how the pointer is known to address the
 * MsgSource subobject at offset 0.
 *
 * All three bases are declared and the three RTTI offsets follow from their sizes rather than being
 * asserted. MsgSource is 0x14 bytes, which places RendererBase at 20. The constructor at
 * `0x00369fb0` confirms that independently: it writes the MsgSource table at `+0x10` rather than at
 * `+0x00`, which is where a class with no base of its own stores its vptr, and the destructor
 * deallocates a three-word `std::vector` at `+0x00` through `+0x0c` below it. RendererBase is 0x48
 * bytes, being its 4-byte MsgSink base, the 0x3c-byte MsgQueue at `+0x04`, and the 8-byte Router at
 * `+0x40`, which places FadeUser at 92. FadeUser is 4 bytes of vptr, which ends the base region at
 * `+0x60`. Each figure is recovered independently of the others, so the three offsets agreeing with
 * the descriptor is a check rather than an assumption.
 *
 * Three vtables belong to the class, one per base, and a slot index restarts in each.
 *
 * The primary table at `0x008091f8` is the MsgSource table and has four entries, the same length as
 * MsgSource's own table at `0x008299f0`. The class therefore declares no virtual of its own, and
 * the only entry that differs is slot 1, the destructor.
 *
 * The RendererBase table at `0x00809198` has eleven entries and adjusts `this` by `-20`. A diff
 * against RendererBase's own table at `0x007d2d20` reads overrides at slots 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9,
 * and 10, with slots 2 and 6 inherited. Slots 3, 7, and 8 store the `__pure_virtual` stub at
 * `0x005381a8` in the base, so this class is what makes the renderer concrete.
 *
 * The FadeUser table at `0x00809170` has four entries and adjusts `this` by `-92`. Every entry
 * differs from FadeUser's own table at `0x007ec070`, and the two that matter are slots 2 and 3,
 * both of which are pure in the base.
 *
 * The object is at least 0xd8 bytes. Nothing derives from the class, so no base offset in any
 * descriptor pins the total, and the figure is the lower bound the constructor's highest store
 * gives.
 *
 * Six of the eight RendererBase overrides take the names RendererBase declares them under, and
 * what each override does is recorded on its declaration.
 *
 * `0x00390088` and `0x00390090` are empty bodies that take the renderer. Every caller, from nine
 * screens and the renderer's own OnFreqEnded(), reaches the same single copy of each, so they are
 * ordinary members, OnReturnFromGame() and OnReturnToMenus().
