/**
 * Base of every front-end screen.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008eed98`. It has MsgSink as its one public non-virtual base at
 * offset 0. MetMemDetectScreen, MetSaveRemix, MetSoloWinScreen, and seven further classes fix the
 * object at 0x8c bytes by placing their second base at `+140`. The vtable is at `0x0080b6a0`.
 * A walk of the table reads 39 entries, slots 0 to 38, followed by an all-zero terminating entry at
 * `0x0080b838` and then the next class's table at `0x0080b840`. The terminator is not a slot.
 *
 * Thirty-two classes derive directly from the class, and five intermediate classes sit between it
 * and their own children, MetGizmoPanel, MetJukeboxBaseScreen, MetMultiTipsBaseScreen,
 * MetPauseBaseScreen, and MetScreenMultiSoundBank.
 *
 * A screen manages a Rnd::View loaded from a `.rnd` container. The constructor records the
 * container name and, when both name arguments are non-empty, starts the load with a direct call to
 * slot 18's body rather than a dispatch through the table. That is what a virtual call from a
 * constructor compiles to, and the destructor invokes slot 13 the same way.
 *
 * Slot 14 polls the RndAsyncLoader until the load completes and then runs slot 38, which resolves
 * the view by appending `.view` to the container name and resolves the two animation views by
 * formatting `%s_EE.anim` and `%s_BF.anim` from the screen name. A screen with no view stops the
 * machine through Fatal() with `the screen %s doesn't have a valid view!`.
 *
 * Every float this class passes or receives for an animation is a frame position rather than a time
 * in seconds. MetRenderer advances the field at its own `+0x68` by a rate at `+0x64` that defaults
 * to 500, and hands the result to Rnd::Animatable::SetFrame(). That is what makes the arithmetic
 * here coherent: mEnterStartTime and mExitStartTime store frame positions, mAnimEndFrame stores the
 * enter animation's end frame from Rnd::View::FilteredFrameEnd(), and UpdateEnterAnimation()
 * subtracts one from the sum of the other two.
 *
 * The 39 entries follow in table order. Slot 0 is the compiler-generated GetTypeInfo at
 * `0x0038fd78` and is not source. An entry marked empty is a two-instruction `jr ra` stub. Each
 * such stub sits at its own address and several derived tables address the same stub, so the stub
 * is an out-of-line definition rather than an inline body, and this class owes one definition for
 * each.

 *
 * A walk of all 78 tables in the image that share at least twelve entries with this one settles
 * which of the empty slots a derived class fills. Slot 19 is filled 53 times, slot 15 23 times,
 * slot 27 6 times, slot 16 twice, and slot 11 once. Slots 10, 12, and 13 are filled by no derived
 * table at all.
 *
 * Five of the six sound slots take one integer argument. MetKeyboardScreen::StartRepeatingSound()
 * at `0x0028c5e0` loads its own selector into `a1` immediately before each of its five virtual
 * calls, to slots 20, 22, 23, 24, and 25, so the argument is set at a call site rather than
 * inherited from a register. The same class overrides four of the five and each override reads `a1`
 * and compares it against the selector it recorded.
 *
 * The selector is the controller index. DeliverCommand() loads it from `+0x04` of the command
 * record, MetRenderer::DispatchPriv rejects a command whose `+0x04` exceeds its own bound at
 * `+0xd4` before delivering it, and the translator at `0x002e3738` copies that word out of the
 * input message unchanged. A screen that records -1 plays its sound for every controller.
 *
 * PlayLeaveSound() takes the selector as well. DeliverCommand() loads `a1` from the same `+0x04`
 * for slot 21 at `0x0038b7e8` exactly as it does for the other five, and the
 * MetConfigControllerScreen override at `0x00206970` compares it against its own controller.
 *
 * Four data members are protected and the rest are private. MetRemixLoadScreen and
 * MetRemixDelScreen both clear mShowsLoadedDrawables in their constructors, and MetSaveRemixScreen
 * clears mPlaysCommandSounds in its own. Four derived constructors append to mHelpKeys, and
 * MetJukeboxBaseScreen::SetShowing() reads mViewsUnresolved. Those four are written or read by
 * derived code and the others are not. No code outside the class and its children reads a
 * member.
