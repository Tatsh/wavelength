class Message;

/**
 * Base of every renderer, with a message queue and a router of its own.
 *
 * It derives from MsgSink at offset 0, with its own type function at `0x00139e88`. Three classes
 * derive from it: MetRenderer, MetNullRenderer, and Renderer. Each of their constructors calls this
 * class's constructor directly.
 *
 * The table at `0x007d2d20` runs eleven entries against MsgSink's four, so slots 4 through 10 are
 * the seven virtuals this class introduces. Slots 3, 7, and 8 address the pure-virtual stub at
 * `0x005381a8`, and the class is therefore abstract. Slot 3 is MsgSink::DispatchPriv(), which this
 * class leaves pure. Slot 2 overrides MsgSink::Dispatch().
 *
 * Each of the seven takes its name from the overrides and from the callers. MetaGameWorld runs
 * slots 4 and 5 to start and stop the front end, GameManagerImpl::DrawFrame() runs slots 6, 7, and
 * 8 on every frame, and GameManagerImpl::DrawFrameSimple() runs slots 9 and 10. The six
 * MetRenderer overrides take no argument and return nothing, and Renderer's three overrides agree.
 * Those overrides fix the signatures. The base bodies of slots 4, 5, 9, and 10 are empty and do
 * not read an argument register.
