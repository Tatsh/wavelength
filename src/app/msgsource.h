/**
 * Sender of engine messages, which stores the list of sinks that receive them.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x0086f6b0`. It has no base. One data word sits ahead of the vector.
 * The compiler places the vptr after both at `+0x10`, and the subobject is 0x14 bytes. Around
 * thirty classes derive from it, among them Player, InputMap, Renderer, and MsgQueue. MsgQueue
 * derives from both this class and MsgSink, and its MsgSink subobject therefore sits at `+0x14`.
 *
 * The vector is three pointers, measured from the destructor and from both accessors: `+0x04`
 * start, `+0x08` finish, `+0x0c` end of storage. Every operation on it is inlined apart from the
 * reallocating half of push_back() at `0x00549e08`. The vector is private. Only members of this
 * class address it.
 *
 * The class declares no constructor, and the two the compiler generates are emitted once each, in
 * the Gamer unit. The default constructor at `0x00115cc0` empties the vector and writes the vptr,
 * and AutoRiffer, AxeFX, and the other derived constructors call it. The copy constructor at
 * `0x00115860` copies the word at `+0x00` and the vector.
