class Message;

/**
 * Receiver of engine messages.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x0086f780`, built from the length-prefixed literal at `0x007cccb0`
 * with no base list. The class declares no data member, and the compiler-generated vptr therefore
 * lands at offset 0 over a four-byte subobject. Player corroborates the size by
 * placing its MsgSink base at `+0x08` and its MsgSource base at `+0x0c`. 134 classes derive from
 * MsgSink and 40 of them derive directly.
 *
 * The vtable at `0x007ccc40` runs four entries and a zero terminator: the type function, the
 * destructor, Dispatch(), and DispatchPriv(). The DispatchPriv() entry addresses the shared
 * pure-virtual stub at `0x005381a8`, the target of 355 slots across the image. That entry marks
 * the member pure rather than defaulted.
 *
 * The destructor and Dispatch() are defined inline. g++ 2.9x emitted the vtable into every
 * translation unit that constructs or destroys a derived object, producing 45 byte-identical
 * copies, and emitted the two bodies alongside them. 48 further copies of the destructor, 104 of
 * Dispatch(), and 44 of the type function remain in the image. Every copy that occupies no vtable
 * slot is referenced only from a frame-unwind record. The reconstruction therefore owes two
 * definitions rather than 196.
 *
 * Five derived classes have an implicitly declared destructor emitted at a distinct address and
 * byte-identical to this one. A trivial derived destructor stores only the base table pointer once
 * the compiler discards the dead store of its own. Those five are NoteFinder at `0x00105588`,
 * RendererBase::Router at `0x00139d70`, MidiChase at `0x001a67d8`, the file-local Shifter of
 * GsMuseUtil.cpp at `0x001ab878`, and RiffRangeFinder at `0x001c4200`. The reconstruction declares
 * none of the five. The compiler generates each one.
