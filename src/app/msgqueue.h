/**
 * Relay that stores a copy of every message it accepts and forwards to its own sinks.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x00902220`. It derives from MsgSource at offset 0 and from MsgSink at
 * `+0x14`. The base records in the descriptor give both offsets directly. The object is 0x3c bytes,
 * fixed by GameManagerImpl embedding one at `+0xc0` and writing its next member at `+0xfc`. Two
 * vtables belong to the class. The table at `0x00829b18` is addressed by the MsgSource subobject
 * and inherits both of that base's virtuals unchanged; the table at `0x00829af0` is addressed by
 * the MsgSink subobject, adjusts `this` by `-0x14` on every entry it overrides, and inherits
 * MsgSink::Dispatch() with no adjustment at all.
 *
 * Deriving from both mix-ins is the whole design. A message arrives through the MsgSink side,
 * which stores a copy, and arrives at its readers through the inherited MsgSource sink list.
 * GameManagerImpl demonstrates the arrangement: its constructor builds the embedded queue and then
 * registers itself as a sink of it at `0x00105fec`.
 *
 * The queue owns its stored messages. The destructor deletes every element of both vectors through
 * Message's virtual destructor, which is what establishes the ownership and in turn establishes
 * that Message::Clone() returns a heap copy.
 *
 * Poll() at `0x0054aa58` is the drain, and it shows what the pair of vectors is for. Poll() points
 * mTarget at the vector it is not iterating. A message that a sink stores while receiving an
 * earlier one lands in the other vector, and the iteration is undisturbed.
