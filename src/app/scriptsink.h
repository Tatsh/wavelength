/**
 * Message sink that runs the script text a message supplies.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x00901e60`. It has MsgSink as its one base. The object is eight
 * bytes. The compiler-generated vptr lands at offset 0, and the Globals back pointer occupies
 * `+0x04`. Globals::InitServices() at `0x001170d0` allocates eight bytes, stores the Globals
 * pointer at `+0x04`, and writes the vptr, and CreateInstance() does the same. The table at
 * `0x007cee50` runs GetTypeInfo, the destructor, the inherited MsgSink::Dispatch(), then the
 * override below.
 *
 * Globals creates the single instance in Init() and destroys it in Shutdown(). The sink accepts
 * every message, acts only on one identity, and is registered broadly.
 * The allocation tag on both construction paths reads `MsgSink` rather than `ScriptSink`, because
 * a tag names the class that declares the operator and this class inherits the pair from its base.
 *
 * The Globals back pointer is private, because no recovered routine reads it. The constructor
 * stores it and nothing else recovered so far uses it.
