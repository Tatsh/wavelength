/**
 * In-game renderer that drives the tunnel, the overlay, and the arena for one game.
 *
 * Its RTTI descriptor is at `0x008efc70`. It has two public non-virtual bases, MsgSource at `+0x00`
 * and RendererBase at `+0x14`. Its type function is at `0x00431f18`.
 *
 * The base offsets follow from the base sizes in the same way as for MetRenderer. MsgSource is 0x14
 * bytes and RendererBase is 0x48, and the first member of this class is therefore at `+0x5c`. The
 * object is 0xa8 bytes, the size the allocation at `0x0018cadc` requests under the MsgSink tag.
 * The allocating routine, at `0x0018caa8`, is the constructor's one caller and stores the result at
 * `+0x28` of the world.
 *
 * Two tables belong to the class. The MsgSource table at `0x0081a110` has four entries, the same
 * length as MsgSource's table, and only the destructor differs. The RendererBase table at
 * `0x0081a0b0` has eleven entries and adjusts `this` by `-20`. A diff against RendererBase's table
 * at `0x007d2d20` reads overrides at slots 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8, and inheritance at slots 2, 4, 5, 9,
 * and 10. Slots 3, 7, and 8 are pure in the base, and this class makes the renderer concrete.
 *
 * The constructor records the object in g_pRenderer and the destructor clears it. The three
 * objects the renderer builds (AppTunnel, Overlay, and TnlArena) are also its three message sinks.
 * MsgSource::Send() delivers every message DispatchPriv() does not consume to all three.
 *
 * The translation unit also defines seven static routines over five async loaders and two cached
 * names, all file-scope globals. The front end starts the loads and the constructor waits for them.
 *
 * The unreferenced forwarder at `0x00432440` in this unit, byte-identical to
 * MsgJoiner::DispatchPriv() at `0x00195b70`, has its unwind record at `0x006e32b8` as its only
 * reference and is recorded here rather than declared.
